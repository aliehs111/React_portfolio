## Resources and Contributors
The documentation for the React-bootstrap was very helpful in integrating React with Bootstrap. https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/<br>
This YouTube video by Sonny Sangha helped me better understand props in React: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHJSNFU7H4U&t=707s

The React router is a little tricky wiht GitHub pages if you have never done it before.  I suggest the following resources that helped me resolved some issues once I deployed the app.  What works on localhost doesn't alway work with the deployed app, especially with client side routing and rendering a SPA on GitHub Pages.<br>
