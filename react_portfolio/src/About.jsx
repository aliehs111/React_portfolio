            Ok...so here's where I am supposed to say here that I am a fullstack
            web developer. I survived 6 months of the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp
            for fullstack web development. While I somehow managed to do really
            well in the class, there is still so much I want learn. My
            competitive nature kicks in when I'm working on some small detail on
            an app and I am determined to meet any functionality the project
            requires. I have so much respect for the developer community and I
            want to be a part of it. I went all in and became very resourceful
            getting through this course, which is how I gained the wisdom to know
            how much more there is to know.{" "}
            <em>
              But there's no doubt in my mind that I am up for any challenge and
              I'm confident in my ability to figure it out!
